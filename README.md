The goal of hello.world is to prove you can install and use an R package
from us:

- Your version of R is new enough to work with our packages.
- You can access a CRAN, which distributes the dependencies of our
  packages.
- You can access at least one of the platforms where we release our
  packages.
- You can understand our standard instructions to install and use our
  packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hello.world from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/hello.world")
```

## Example

``` r
library(hello.world)

hello_world()
#> [1] "Hello world!"
```
