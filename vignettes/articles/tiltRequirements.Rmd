title: "Requirements to install and use tilt packages"

## Hardware

In a fresh system, 8 GB RAM and 4 AMD CPUs were enough to run the most intensive
processes. On your laptop use 16 GB RAM or more, since it needs some memory for
other processes.

## Software

* Operative system: Our packages are tested on the latest version of Windows, Mac,
and Ubuntu, and with R >= 4.1.0 (released on 2021-05-18).
* [Install R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio).
* R packages: When you install an R package, all of its dependencies install
automatically. You can find them in [the DESCRIPTION
file](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#the-description-file) under
"Depends:", "Imports:", "Suggests:", and "Remotes:"
([example](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3A2DegreesInvesting%2FtiltRequirements++path%3ADESCRIPTION+%22Imports%3A%22&type=code)).

## R setup

* [Always start R with a blank slate](https://rstats.wtf/source-and-blank-slates#always-start-r-with-a-blank-slate).
* Work from [RStudio projects](https://rstats.wtf/projects#rstudio-projects).

## Expertise

* It's nice to have experience using [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
