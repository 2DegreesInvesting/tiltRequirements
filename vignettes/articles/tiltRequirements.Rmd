title: "Requirements to install and use tilt packages"
---

## Expertise

* Ability to [install R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio).
* Ability to install R packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/).
* Experience using [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

## Hardware

In a fresh system, 8 GB RAM and 4 AMD CPUs were enough to run the most intensive
processes. On your laptop use 16 GB RAM or more, since it needs some memory for
other processes.

## Software

* [Install R and RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio).

We ensure our packages work on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu, and with R >= 4.1.0
(2021-05-18).

### R packages

When you install an R package, all of its dependencies install automatically.
You can find them in [the DESCRIPTION
file](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#the-description-file) under
"Depends:", "Imports:", "Suggests:", and "Remotes:"
([example](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3A2DegreesInvesting%2FtiltRequirements++path%3ADESCRIPTION+%22Imports%3A%22&type=code)).

## R setup

* [Always start R with a blank slate](https://rstats.wtf/source-and-blank-slates#always-start-r-with-a-blank-slate).
* Work from [RStudio projects](https://rstats.wtf/projects#rstudio-projects).
